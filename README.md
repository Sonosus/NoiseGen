This is a pink/white noise generator PCB that uses the Electric Druid NOISE2 chip. It is powered with +-12v and is perfect for use in compact synths. It can be used to make a Eurorack/Kosmo module, or in custom synth builds. 

Buy your chips from Electric Druid to help fund their development of future chips like these.
